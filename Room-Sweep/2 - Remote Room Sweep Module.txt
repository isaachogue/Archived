(2) Remote Room Sweep Module
	Epics:
		- Sweep Manager
			** As the sweep manager services I want to periodically poll the RSP hub so that sweep schedules for devices that I am responsible for monitoring will be up-to-date
				- check for sweeps

					Scenario: Sweep manager is configured to poll the hub on a periodic basis
					
						Given the sweep manager is configured to sweep codecs
						And the sweep manager is configured with a polling interval of 60 seconds
						When the sweep manager's polling timer completes
						Then the sweep manager will open a connection to the hub and check for changes to the sweep's details
						
					Scenario: Sweep manager locates a new sweep schedule when polling for sweep details for it's configured codecs
					
						Given the sweep manager is configured to sweep codecs
						And the sweep manager is configured with a polling interval of 60 seconds
						And the sweep manager has no previously scheduled sweeps
						And the hub has new sweeps that have been added
						When the sweep manager's polling timer completes
						Then the sweep manager will open a connection to the hub and check for changes to the sweep's details
						And the sweep manager will locate the newly scheduled sweeps
						
				- update sweep participants based on hub changes
					Scenario: Sweep manager locates a codec that has been marked as exempt when polling for sweep details for it's configured codecs 
					
						Given the sweep manager is configured to sweep codecs
						And the sweep manager is configured with a polling interval of 60 seconds
						And the sweep manager has previously scheduled sweeps
						And the hub has a previously scheduled codec marked as exempt
						When the sweep manager's polling timer completes
						Then the sweep manager will open a connection to the hub and check for changes to the sweep's details
						And the sweep manager will locate the newly exempt codec in the scheduled sweeps
						And the sweep manager will remove the codec from the scheduled sweeps

					Scenario: Sweep manager locates a new codec that has been added to a sweep when polling for sweep details for it's configured codecs 
					
						Given the sweep manager is configured to sweep codecs
						And the sweep manager is configured with a polling interval of 60 seconds
						And the sweep manager has previously scheduled sweeps
						And the hub has a newly scheduled codec included in the sweep
						When the sweep manager's polling timer completes
						Then the sweep manager will open a connection to the hub and check for changes to the sweep's details
						And the sweep manager will locate the newly added codec in the scheduled sweeps
						And the sweep manager will add the codec into the scheduled sweep
										
				- update existing sweep schedules based on hub changes
					Scenario: Sweep manager locates a schedule change when polling for sweep details for it's configured codecs 
					
						Given the sweep manager is configured to sweep codecs
						And the sweep manager is configured with a polling interval of 60 seconds
						And the sweep manager has previously scheduled sweeps
						And the hub has a schedule update for one of the previously scheduled sweeps
						When the sweep manager's polling timer completes
						Then the sweep manager will open a connection to the hub and check for changes to the sweep's details
						And the sweep manager will locate the schedule change in the scheduled sweeps
						And the sweep manager will update the scheduled sweep to occur at the newly scheduled time that is included in the scheduled sweeps														
				
			** As the sweep manager services I want to perform a series of pre-sweep boot-strap tests so that reachability is determined before a sweep is initiated
				- A connection test to the endpoint (type of ping);
				- Communications with the endpoint
			** As the sweep manager services I want to initiate a video call from a managed codec to its identified sweep VMR so that I can perform scheduled sweeps of the Codec
				- Codec connecting to the MCU
				- Conference initiation between VMR and the codec
			** As the sweep manager services I want to poll a codec that is participating in a sweep for stats so that I can monitor the health of the codec, its connection to the VMR, and the media connection between the codec and the MCU for the term of the conference
				- Poll each device in the sweep for current stats
				- check stats against configured device thresholds
				
		- Polycom HDX Codec sweep API
			** As the room sweep manager services I want to have the ability to communicate with a Polycom HDX so that I can initiate a connection with a VMR
			** As the room sweep manager services I want to have the ability to collect call statistics from a Polycom HDX so that I can check the stats for threshold violations
				- packet loss, frame rate, preferred audio algorithm, 
					preferred video algorithm, max video format, max bandwidth
			** As the room sweep manager services I want to have the ability to verify basic communications with a Polycom HDX so that I can verify reachability with the Codec
