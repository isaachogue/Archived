Feature: Sync Meetings From Google - Discover Google Calendar Events
        As the VNNOC Symphony Cloud Services
        I want to be notified when a managed space is scheduled for a meeting through google calendar
        So that I can maintain an accurate understanding of the the space's scheduled meetings

Scenario: Inform google calendar to notifiy Symphony of events for a managed space
        Given a user wants to sync one or more of their resource schedules between symphony and an external system
        And a managed space has been selected for synchronization
        When the user makes a request to synchronize their resource
        Then Symphony should notify the external system
#        And the watch request includes an id property
#        And the watch request includes a type property
#        And the watch request includes a Google API registered URI where requests should be provided
#        And the watch request includes a token property with the space GUID
#        Then the result should be an HTTP 200 OK status code

Scenario: Google calendar informs Symphony of new watch request for a space
        Given a google calendar has successfully registered a watch request for a Symphony Space
        And a valid Symphony URI was provided as part of the watch requests
        Then the Symphony URI should recieve a google sync message
        And the message should have a google channel id value
        And the message should have a resource id value
        And the message should have a token property with the space GUID
        And the message should have a resource state of 'sync'
        
Scenario: Google calendar informs Symphony of new event for a space
        Given a google calendar has successfully registered a watch request for a Symphony Space
        And a valid Symphony URI was provided as part of the watch requests
        Then the Symphony URI should recieve a google sync message
        And the message should have a google channel id value
        And the message should have a resource id value
        And the message should have a token property with the space GUID
        And the message should have a resource state of 'exists'
        And the message should have a resource URI where events are located
        And the message should have a message number greater than 1
        And the result should be an HTTP 200 OK status code
        
Scenario: Symphony requests the latest events for a space
        Given Symphony needs to poll a Google Calendar for changes
        And Symphony has a timestamp for the last synchronization time
        When Symphony makes a request and includes the last synchronization time
        Then the response should include only events that are new or modified since the last synchronization
