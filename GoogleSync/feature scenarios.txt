Scenario: Google calendar informs Symphony of new watch request for a space
	Given a symphony space has been registered to recieve google calendar requests
	And an event has been added to the calendar
	Then the Symphony URI should recieve a google sync message
	And the message should have a google channel id value
	And the message should have a resource id value
	And the message should have a token property with the space GUID
	And the message should have a resource state of 'sync'
	
Scenario: Google calendar informs Symphony of new event for a space
	Given a google calendar has successfully registered a watch request for a Symphony Space
	And a valid Symphony URI was provided as part of the watch requests
	Then the Symphony URI should recieve a google sync message
	And the message should have a google channel id value
	And the message should have a resource id value
	And the message should have a token property with the space GUID
	And the message should have a resource state of 'exists'
	And the message should have a resource URI where events are located
	And the message should have a message number greater than 1
	And the result should be an HTTP 200 OK status code
	
Scenario: Symphony requests the latest events for a space since a point in time
	Given Symphony needs to poll a Google Calendar for changes
	And Symphony has a timestamp for the last synchronization time
	When Symphony makes a request and includes the last synchronization time
	Then the response should include only events that are new or modified since the last synchronization
